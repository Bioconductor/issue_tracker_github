My package is consistent with the _Bioconductor_\r\n  [Package Guidelines][1].\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand Bioconductor [Package Naming Policy][9] and acknowledge\r\n  Bioconductor may retain use of package name.\r\n\r\n- [x] I understand that a minimum requirement for package acceptance \r\n  is to pass R CMD check and R CMD BiocCheck with no ERROR or WARNINGS. \r\n  Passing these checks does not result in automatic acceptance. The \r\n  package will then undergo a formal review and recommendations for \r\n  acceptance regarding other Bioconductor standards will be addressed.\r\n\r\n- [x] My package addresses statistical or bioinformatic issues related\r\n  to the analysis and comprehension of high throughput genomic data.\r\n\r\n- [x] I am committed to the long-term maintenance of my package. This\r\n  includes monitoring the [support site][3] for issues that users may\r\n  have, subscribing to the [bioc-devel][4] mailing list to stay aware\r\n  of developments in the _Bioconductor_ community, responding promptly\r\n  to requests for updates from the Core team in response to changes in\r\n  _R_ or underlying software.\r\n  \r\n- [x] I am familiar with the [Bioconductor code of conduct][7] and \r\n  agree to abide by it.\r\n\r\nI am familiar with the essential aspects of _Bioconductor_ software\r\nmanagement, including:\r\n\r\n- [x] The 'devel' branch for new packages and features.\r\n- [x] The stable 'release' branch, made available every six\r\n      months, for bug fixes.\r\n- [x] _Bioconductor_ version control using [Git][5]\r\n  (optionally [via GitHub][6]).\r\n\r\nFor questions/help about the submission process, including questions about\r\nthe output of the automatic reports generated by the SPB (Single Package\r\nBuilder), please use the #package-submission channel of our Community Slack.\r\nFollow the link on the home page of the [Bioconductor website][8] to sign up.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://contributions.bioconductor.org/\r\n[2]: https://bioconductor.org/developers/package-submission/\r\n[3]: https://support.bioconductor.org\r\n[4]: https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/bioc-devel\r\n[5]: http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/git/\r\n[6]: http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/git/sync-existing-repositories/\r\n[7]: https://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/\r\n[8]: https://bioconductor.org/\r\n[9]: https://bioconductor.org/developers/package-submission/#naming",
